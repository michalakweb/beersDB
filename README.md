# Beer DB
> Sample beer database

Working example: [https://michalakweb.github.io/beersDB/](https://michalakweb.github.io/beersDB/)

Website created with create-react-app. Content shown through React. Database is managed via Component state and localStorage (for additional convenience). Since the project is small, I decided not to use Redux. I've set up a couple of "does X component render?" tests, through Jest. Hash History is used, so that project can be deployed to Github Pages. Components include comments to explain some rationales.

## Deployment

### `git clone https://github.com/michalakweb/beersDB.git`

### `npm install || yarn install`
Grab the dependencies.

### `npm start || yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
