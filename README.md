# Happy Tenants
> Keep track of the things that need to be done in your apartment

Happy Tenants is an information tracker that has two features:
- adding items to a todo list
- viewing the current chores for the week.

Working example: [https://michalakweb.github.io/happytenants/](https://michalakweb.github.io/happytenants/)

It's in beta phase and serves more as a showcase of technologies used in it. It's a React app that uses ReactRouter for routing, Redux for managing state and Firebase to serve data among different users.  It's also a Progressive Web App - you can add it to your Andoid/iOS homescreen! 

Currently, all users are allowed to make changes into the firebase and the chores for the week are set programatically. That will change in the future releases. 

## Deployment

### `clone `

### `npm install || yarn install`

### `npm start || yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
