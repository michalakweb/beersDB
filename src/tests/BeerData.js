		"description": "This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color. Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are medium to high, and use of noble-type hops for flavor and aroma is preferred. Up to 25 percent corn and/or rice in the grist should be used. Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze. Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.",

	"description": "The Plato scale is a measurement of the density of liquid. The number tells brewers how big or small a resulting beer will be—the larger the number the bigger the beer. We designed 11.5° Plato—a lower number on the beer scale—to give us just enough body to support a heavy heap of hops. The result is an easy-drinking session IPA which satisfies the thirst for hops, but urges you to have another round.",
